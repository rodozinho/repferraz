This repository contains part of my RStudio experience, i.e., my R portfolio. None of these files are pulled from my computer since the versions here are simplified.

The first file "campaign_cap.R" tries to replicate the paper "Money and Politics: The Effects of Campaign Spending Limits on Political Competition and Incumbency Advantage" by Ferraz et. al. It was developed with the help of Prof. Dimas Fazio.

<!--print a few reproduction outputs and graphs-->

The second file "amazon.R" contains an analysis of deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest, part of my master's dissertation.

None of the .xlsx, .txt and .csv used on these codes are in the repository. If you want, you can request them to me!
