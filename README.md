This repository contains part of my RStudio experience, i.e., my R portifolio.

The first file "ferraz.R" tries to replicate the paper " Money and Politics: The Effects of Campaign Spending Limits on Political Competition and Incumbency Advantage" by Ferraz et. al., with the help of Dimas Fazio

The second file "" contains an analysis of deforestation of the amazon rainforest, part of my master's dissertation.
