# rodr

This repository contains part of my RStudio experience, i.e., my R portfolio. None of these files are pulled from my computer since the versions here are simplified.

# campaign_cap.R

The first file "campaign_cap.R" tries to replicate the paper "Money and Politics: The Effects of Campaign Spending Limits on Political Competition and Incumbency Advantage" by Ferraz et. al. It was developed with the help of Prof. Dimas Fazio. <!--print a few reproduction outputs and graphs-->

# amazon.R

The second file "amazon.R" contains an analysis of deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, part of my master's dissertation. Here, I will try to give an overall perspective on how deforestation behaves on The Amazon rainforest and give some explanations for these patterns. The source of the deforestation increase is PRODES, a Brazilian federal sub-organization that produces information regarding deforestation inside the so-called "Legal Amazon" i.e. municipalities that have Amazon rainforest inside them.

With a simple graph, let's see how deforestation has behaved in the region, since 2006:

Now looking at how this deforestation has behaved geographically since 2006:

It is easy to  see the (in)famous *Brazilian agricultural frontier*:

# summit.R

The last file "summit.R" tries to see if there is some relationship between environmental conferences/summits and the raise of radical leftist perspectives regarding environmental issues.

None of the .xlsx, .txt and .csv used on these codes are in the repository. If you want, you can request them to me!
