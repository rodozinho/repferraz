This repository contains part of my RStudio experience, i.e., my R portfolio.

The first file "campaign_cap.R" tries to replicate the paper "Money and Politics: The Effects of Campaign Spending Limits on Political Competition and Incumbency Advantage" by Ferraz et. al. It was developed with the help of Prof. Dimas Fazio.

The second file "amazon.R" contains an analysis of deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest, part of my master's dissertation.
